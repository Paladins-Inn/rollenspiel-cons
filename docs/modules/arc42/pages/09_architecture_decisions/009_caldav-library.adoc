== Context

The application must synchronize calendar events with Nextcloud using CalDAV.
A robust, well-supported Java library is required for integration in a Spring Boot environment.


== Decision Drivers

* {fs01}
* {co04}
* {ct003}
* {us02}
* {mt01}
* {mt02}


== Decision
We choose **ical4j** for CalDAV integration.

**ical4j** is a mature Java library for handling iCalendar data and CalDAV protocol.
The decision drivers are addressed as follows:

* {fs01}: events are calendar entries.
* {co04}: ical4j supports iCal and CalDAV event management.
* {us02}: ical4j supports i18n.
* {re01}: It has a large user base.
* {mt01}: We can't maintain it ourself. ical4j is open source and actively developed.
* {mt02}: We can use it as a service and therefore our app can follow the 12-factor rules.
* {ct003}: ical4j is compatible with Spring Boot and modern Java versions.


== Consequences

* Fast onboarding and reliable support
* Easy updates and bugfixes due to active development
* Good compatibility with Spring Boot and modern Java
* Community support for troubleshooting
* License model (Apache 2.0) fits project needs


== Options

=== Option 1: ical4j

*License:* Apache 2.0

*Pros:*

* Mature Java library for iCalendar and CalDAV
* Good documentation and active development
* Large user base and community
* Maven Central support

* Open source, permissive license (Apache 2.0)
* Supports modern Java versions
* Fulfills maintainability and reliability requirements

*Cons:*

* API can be complex for advanced CalDAV features
* Some CalDAV operations require manual handling


=== Option 2: sabre/dav (via REST API)

*License:* MIT

*Pros:*

* Used by Nextcloud as backend (full protocol support)
* Large community (Nextcloud ecosystem)
* REST API can be consumed with any HTTP client (flexible)
* Open source, permissive license (MIT)

*Cons:*
