|[[rpg]]RPG (Role Playing Game)
|A tabletop role-playing game is a game where participants embody fictional characters in an imaginary world. A game master (also called GM or dungeon master) describes the game world and narrative, while players describe the actions of their characters. The gameplay is typically structured by rulebooks, dice, and other tools. Unlike computer games, tabletop RPGs take place around a table and thrive on direct social interaction between participants. Well-known examples include "Dungeons & Dragons," "Pathfinder," "The Dark Eye," or "Call of Cthulhu."

|[[principle-solid]]SOLID
| In software programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.

* **S**ingle responsible principle
* **O**pen-closed principle

* **I**nterface segregation principle
